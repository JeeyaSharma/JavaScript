/*
An event due to which the normal flow of execution of the code is disrupted is known as an Error

Errors are of two types: 

1. Compile-Time errors:
-> Errors which are detected while the code is compiling
-> these are the errors which are caught during parsing(process of converting to machine language) of code before the execution of the code
-> Eg: Syntax Error

2. Run-Time errors:
-> These are the errors that occur while the code is executing.
-> Eg: Reference Error
 */

// Compile-Time Error

console.log(1; //this throws a syntax error


// Run-time Error

console.log(x); //this throws a Reference error
